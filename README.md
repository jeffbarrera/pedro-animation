# PEDro Papers Animation

Quick side project making an animated time-series plot of the Physiotherapy research papers indexed in the [PEDro database](https://www.pedro.org.au).

Created in R using [gganimate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gganimate/index.html). Heavily drawn from the answers in [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53162821/animated-sorted-bar-chart-with-bars-overtaking-each-other).
